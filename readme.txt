This project is a spectrometer based on Nexys4DDR.
This project uses VHDL language and Vivado 2019.1.
You need to use a VGA monitor to see the output which should be connected to the board.

This spectrometer displays the sound signal and its spectrum in real time and The sound frequency can reach 11kHz which is limited by the microphone chip in development board.If you want to reach higher frequency,you can connect another high-performance microphone chip to the board.

To run this porject,
